Description: Estimation of mean squared prediction error of a small area predictor is provided. In particular, the recent method of Simple, Unified, Monte-Carlo Assisted approach for the mean squared prediction error estimation of small area predictor is provided. We also provide other existing methods of mean squared prediction error estimation such as jackknife method for the mixed logistic model.
